Team 6's attempt at implementating the Asteroids arcade game, with some impressive (and noisy) sound effects.

How to play:
* Use up, down, left and right keys to turn and move in a specific direction
* Shoot using the space bar.
* The aim is to destroy the asteroids. You get 50 points for every asteroid you shoot and destroy.
* Avoid crashing into the asteroids. If this happens it will be game over!

Requires [pgzero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

All sounds/music/images used are public domain as far as is known.

To run: `python asteroids.py`
